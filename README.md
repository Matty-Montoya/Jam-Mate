# JAM MATE

### JamMate Client
This is the client side of the JamMate application. JamMate allows users to create instrument that they play with a specified genre; additionally, users can view a list of other users and their postings of instruments played. This application will allow users to find other individuals that they would like to jam with.

### Planning and Development:

#### Planning:
  I wanted to create a practical and user friendly application that a user could see themselves using on a daily basis. I was unsure as to what to create at first but eventaully landed on creating an application for musicians. The application would allow musicians to locate other local musicians to jam with and would present what instruments they played with the type of genre. I had originally planned out what would be a version 3 of my project but started with creating a link between a user and their instrument to begin.


#### Development:
  The first step to making sure I would reach MVP were to create the respective folders and files. I created two folders for client actions: the first was the user actions and the api, events, and ui files that would allow me to have user authentication. The second was the user actions in regards to the create of instruments and the index of all artists from the database. In addition to the user creating an instrument, users could update and remove their own instruments from their respective list. Users do not have the capability to alter anoher artists' list of instruments.

   Once those files were created and all ajax request were written. I created the hmtl and css files that would allow for the user to sign in and in addtion to create their instruments, etc with the use of handlebars. Handlebars did a majority of the interaction between the client and the api and would return that infromation in the form of html.

### Future Goals

This is a project that I would continue working on as I feel it is something that everyday users would love to use.
- I want to add a profile system that will allow users to have a more in depth represntation of their musical background.
- Links to a user's musical demos
- A more in depth web design that is user friendly and unique.
- A rating/review system for users.
- Message system that will allow users to interact with one another.
- And More!
